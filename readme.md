In 2009 I went to a [design conference] where [Manu Sporny] talked about [RDFa]. At the time, I worked for an [academic university library] and was deeply entrenched in the doctrine of metadata. RDFa and other [microformats] were a great evolution in making the web more semantic, usable, and shareable.

Inspired by Manu's presentation, I volunteered to redesign the [RDFa] site. They were using one of the default WordPress themes. I thought the ideas deserved a unique and inspiring treatment. I put together this prototype and built a WordPress theme from it. They used my RDFa WordPress theme on the site for a couple years.

I am grateful that they condescended to do so. It was very satisfying for me to contribute to their work in this way. I learned a lot through the process of developing this design and building it myself.
